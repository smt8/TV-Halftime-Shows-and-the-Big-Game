# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game

This project involves loading, cleaning, and exploring Super Bowl data in the age of soaring ad costs and flashy halftime shows.

This project gives an opportunity to apply the skills from Intermediate Python for Data Science Course on DataCamp (https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science).

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
